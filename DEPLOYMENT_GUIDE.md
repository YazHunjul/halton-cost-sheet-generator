## 🔍 Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify these features work:

### ✅ Core Functionality

- [ ] Project creation (Canopy & RecoAir)
- [ ] Excel cost sheet generation
- [ ] Word quotation generation
- [ ] File upload/download

### ✅ Template Access

- [ ] Excel templates load correctly
- [ ] Word templates process properly
- [ ] All business logic functions

### ✅ User Interface

- [ ] Professional Halton branding
- [ ] Responsive design
- [ ] Error handling

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: "Module not found" errors
**Solution**: Check that all imports use relative paths and `src` directory is properly configured

**Issue**: Template files not found
**Solution**: Verify templates are in the repository and paths are relative

**Issue**: Memory errors on large files
**Solution**: Streamlit Cloud has memory limits - optimize file processing

**Issue**: Slow performance
**Solution**: Use caching with `@st.cache_data` for expensive operations

### Debug Mode

To enable debug mode locally:

```bash
streamlit run app.py --logger.level=debug
```

## 📊 Performance Optimization

### Recommended Caching

Add these to your functions for better performance:

```python
@st.cache_data
def load_template_workbook():
    # Cache template loading
    pass

@st.cache_data
def process_large_excel_file(file_data):
    # Cache file processing
    pass
```

### Memory Management

- Process files in chunks for large datasets
- Clear temporary files after processing
- Use generators for large data iterations

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### File Upload Security

- Validate file types and sizes
- Scan uploaded files for malicious content
- Limit file upload sizes (current: 200MB)

### Data Privacy

- Don't log sensitive customer data
- Clear temporary files after processing
- Use secure file handling practices

## 📈 Monitoring & Analytics

### Streamlit Cloud Analytics

- Monitor app usage in Streamlit Cloud dashboard
- Track performance metrics
- Monitor error rates

### Custom Analytics (Optional)

```python
# Add to your app for usage tracking
import streamlit as st

def track_usage(action):
    # Log usage events
    st.session_state.setdefault('usage_log', []).append({
        'action': action,
        'timestamp': datetime.now()
    })
```

## 🚀 Advanced Deployment Options

### Custom Domain (Pro Feature)

1. Upgrade to Streamlit Cloud Pro
2. Configure custom domain in settings
3. Update DNS records

### Environment Variables

Set in Streamlit Cloud dashboard:

- `ENVIRONMENT=production`
- `DEBUG_MODE=false`

### Secrets Management

For sensitive data, use Streamlit secrets:

```toml
# .streamlit/secrets.toml (not in git)
[database]
username = "your_username"
password = "your_password"
```

## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### Regular Updates

- Monitor Streamlit updates
- Update dependencies regularly
- Test after each deployment

### Backup Strategy

- Keep templates in version control
- Regular database backups (if applicable)
- Document configuration changes

### User Support

- Monitor user feedback
- Track common issues
- Maintain documentation

## 🎯 Success Metrics

Track these KPIs after deployment:

- **User Adoption**: Number of active users
- **Feature Usage**: Most used features
- **Performance**: Average response times
- **Reliability**: Uptime percentage
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback scores

## 📝 Post-Deployment Checklist
