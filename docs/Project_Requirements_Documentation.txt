# PROJECT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENTATION
# Halton Commercial Kitchen Ventilation Cost Sheet & Quotation System

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The business requires a comprehensive digital solution to streamline the quotation process for commercial kitchen ventilation systems. Currently, the process involves manual creation of cost sheets and quotation documents, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and lacks consistency.
